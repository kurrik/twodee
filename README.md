# twodee

A library for 2d games using OpenGL and Go.

Under heavy development, we have been using this for Ludum Dare competitions
so it changes from time to time.

## Features

 - Menus
 - Sound
 - Animations
 - Fullscreen mode
 - Keyboard / Mouse / Gamepad events
 - Building on OSX / Linux / Windows
 - Game grid + pathfinding
 - Import from Tiled native file format (http://www.mapeditor.org/)
 - Some effects shaders (like Glow)

## Setup

This project depends on thirdparty libraries in order to function correctly.
The most consistent way to build these is to use the
[pikkpoiss/twodee-support](https://github.com/pikkpoiss/twodee-support)
library.  Follow the instructions there to set things up correctly.
